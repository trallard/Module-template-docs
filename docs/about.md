## What is Modules template?

Modules template is a Jekyll template tailored specifically for use by academics and researchers wanting to generate a _literate programming friendly_ and _hassle free_ static website.
This can be used as a scientific blog template or as a webpage to host/display projects information, scientific outputs or as a site for academic modules.

It's features include the ability to create blog posts, create and host [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations and render mathematical equarions using LaTeX syntax. It also enables tight integration with Jupyter notebooks.

It is also designed to be hosted on GitHub pages. Modules template allows you to create a well designed, functional and completely free website. Hosting on GitHub pages allows you to keep the website in one place, even if you move between institutions.

## What is a Static Website?
Static websites are websites that do not require a database to store and deliver content to site visitors. In some ways static websites are more similar to early websites in that they rely primarily upon HTML and CSS to serve rather simple content to visitors. However, do not let the simplicity imply that they are somehow inferior to a dynamic website option such as WordPress.

Static websites have many advantages over dynamic websites. They are relatively simple to maintain, fast to load and incredibly secure. By creating a website that is not overly reliant upon third party software platforms you remain in total control of your content. You know exactly where every file for the website is, and do not have to worry about your content becoming trapped in a proprietary system or database.


## What is a Static Website Generator?
A static website generator is a tool that takes flat files and processes them into the necessary HTML and CSS files to become a website. In the case of Jekyll Academic the majority of the files are written using the Markdown markup language. It is a simplified text markup language that allows you to mimic the features of HTML without needing to know HTML. Jekll is built using the Ruby programming language, it can take the Markdown and sass files that are in the Jekyll Academic directory and process those files, creating a fully functioning website.

## Is this the right type of site for me?
While there are many advantages of using a static website generator to create your academic website, it may not be the right tool for everyone. This type of website is best suited for websites consisting mainly of static text content. If you are looking for a site to host some presentations, course materials, Jupyter notebooks, as well as some text based pages (course notes, blog posts) it will likely suit your needs.
